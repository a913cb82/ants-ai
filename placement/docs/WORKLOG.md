## 1 — duel the highest sigma opponent (2026-10-03)
- commit: 244a46b
- score: mean 30.4425 over seeds 0-4 (31.0441, 31.2195, 30.0309, 29.8662, 30.0520)
- champion mean: 28.9678 (cf594fd, baseline row)
- verdict: discard
- what changed: dueled the most uncertain pool opponent instead of the closest mu.
- what you learned: chasing sigma cost about 1.47 mean error; uncertain opponents are often misrated newcomers, so updates are noisier than evenly matched duels.
- next: duel the strongest pool estimate.

"""Codetiger precomputed-resolution combat (Tables2 entry).

Faithful port of the codetiger Python datapoint
(autoresearch/docs/RESEARCH.md, "codetiger Python time datapoint"):
full battle search is infeasible in Python under the turn limit, so
local battle outcomes are PRECOMPUTED once at setup into lookup
tables derived from the engine's focus-battle rules (an ant dies
iff its minimum enemy nearby-count is <= its own nearby-count).
Per-turn contact decisions
are pure table lookups -- the turn loop never resolves a battle
live per ant. Friendless 1v1 sacrifices (mutual-death trades) are
allowed ONLY within radius 14 of a held home hill, hiding the
replacement cost; elsewhere they always refuse.

Board economy (clustered denial food claims), threatened-hill
detection, guard (hold plus off-hill screen), muster, reinforce,
explore, and walk-off match champion Crowd; only the combat core
(majority filter, committed join, grinder army gate,
crowd-fearless, influence) is replaced by the table lookup plus
the hill-gated trade rule. One step past the base table: support
counts only mutually-engaged pals (a pal counts iff at least one
counted foe is inside its attack range), so phantom backing no
longer prices TRADE/LOSE fights as WINs. Self-contained: stdlib plus ants.py
only, never combat.py.
